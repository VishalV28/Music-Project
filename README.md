- **Week 3-4:** Data Visualization, Initial Insights and Statistical Analysis
- **Week 5-6:** ML, Insight generation and reporting
- **Week 7-8:** Project Presentation and Dashboard Creation.

### Step 2: Data Preparation: Collection and Cleaning

#### 2.1. **Identify Data Sources:**
- **Historical Music Sales Data:**
  - Billboard charts.
  - Nielsen SoundScan reports.
  - Music industry reports (e.g., IFPI, RIAA).
- **Streaming Data:**
  - Spotify, Apple Music (publicly available data, reports).
- **Additional Data:**
  - Public datasets like Kaggle, etc.
  - Economic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation).
  - Population data (for per capita analysis).

#### 2.2. **Collecting Data:**
- **Scraping or Downloading:**
  - Scrape or download data from chosen sources (multiple if required).
  - Use Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) for web scraping.
  - Download datasets from sources like Kaggle, official reports, or APIs.

#### 2.3. **Data Cleaning:**
Handle missing values, Standardize formats (e.g., dates, genre names) & Remove duplicates.
- **Handle Missing Values:**
  - Impute missing data or exclude incomplete records.
- **Standardize Formats:**
  - Ensure consistency in date formats, genre names, artist names.
- **Remove Duplicates:**
  - Identify and remove duplicate entries.
- **Data Transformation:**
  - Aggregate data by year, genre, artist, etc.
  - Create new variables if needed (e.g., sales per capita).

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### 3.1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
- Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of sales.
- Summarize data by genre, format, and artist.
#### 3.2. **Trend Analysis:**
- Create time series plots to visualize sales trends.
- Identify seasonal patterns and anomalies.
#### 3.3. **Genre and Artist Analysis:**
- Bar charts and pie charts to show genre and artist distributions.
- Identify top genres and artists over time.
- Genre sales comparison.
- Top-selling artists.
- Artist contributions to genre sales.

### Step 4: Data Visualization
#### 4.1. **Tools:**
- Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).
- Tableau or Power BI for interactive visualizations.
#### 4.2. **Create Visualizations:**
- Line charts for trends over time.
- Bar charts for genre and artist comparisons.
- Pie charts for market share of formats.
- Heatmaps for geographical sales distribution.
- Interactive dashboards for user-driven exploration.

### Step 5: Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning
#### 5.1. **Statistical Tests:**
- Hypothesis testing (e.g., impact of streaming on sales).
#### 5.2. **Predictive Modeling:**
- Time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for future sales.
- Regression analysis to identify factors affecting sales.
- Clustering to segment artists or genres based on sales patterns.
